# Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture of the Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform. The platform is designed to support multiple tenants (organizations) with complete data isolation and shared infrastructure.

## Core Components

### 1. Tenant Management

The platform uses a schema-based tenant isolation approach in PostgreSQL:

- Each tenant gets their own database schema
- Schemas are automatically created when tenants are registered
- Data is fully isolated between tenants
- The `TenantContextService` maintains the current tenant context throughout request processing

### 2. Authentication & Authorization System

The platform implements a comprehensive auth system:

- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Permission-based access control
- Tenant-aware auth guards and decorators

### 3. Database Architecture

- Schema-based multi-tenancy in PostgreSQL
- Custom TypeORM naming strategy to automatically route to correct schemas
- Base entities for shared functionality
- Tenant-aware repositories

### 4. API Structure

- RESTful API with NestJS controllers
- Tenant-specific endpoints
- Swagger documentation

## Request Flow

1. Request arrives with tenant information (header, subdomain, or JWT)
2. `TenantContextMiddleware` extracts tenant ID and sets context
3. Request is processed with tenant context maintained
4. Database operations are automatically scoped to tenant's schema
5. Response is returned with tenant-specific data

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: NestJS (Node.js) with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with schema-based isolation
- **Authentication**: JWT/Passport.js
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Future Enhancements

- Implement database migrations for schema changes
- Add email verification functionality
- Create admin interface for tenant and user management
- Add metrics and monitoring system
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
