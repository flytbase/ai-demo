# API Versioning Strategy

This document outlines the API versioning strategy for the Multi-Tenant SaaS platform.

## Overview

The platform implements a comprehensive API versioning approach that:

- Uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Provides clear documentation for all API versions
- Maintains backward compatibility where possible
- Offers smooth migration paths between versions
- Provides proper deprecation notices

## Versioning Approach

### URI Path Versioning

We use URI path versioning to differentiate between API versions:

- V1 API (Current): `/api/v1/resource`
- V2 API (When available): `/api/v2/resource`

This approach makes API versions explicit and easy to track in logs and monitoring.

### Version Headers

The API also supports version headers for clients that prefer header-based versioning:

```
X-API-Version: 1
```

The header-based approach can be used as an alternative to URI path versioning.

## Version Lifecycle

API versions follow this lifecycle:

1. **Beta** - Initial development phase, may have breaking changes
2. **Stable** - Production-ready, backward compatibility guaranteed
3. **Deprecated** - Will be removed in a future release
4. **Sunset** - No longer available

Once an API version reaches "Stable" status, we maintain backward compatibility for all subsequent minor versions.

## Breaking Changes

Breaking changes require a new major version. Examples of breaking changes include:

- Removing or renaming fields
- Changing field types
- Removing endpoints
- Changing endpoint behaviors
- Changing authentication mechanisms

## Deprecation Policy

When APIs are deprecated:

1. Clear deprecation notices appear in the API documentation
2. A deprecation header is included in API responses
3. Deprecation emails are sent to affected clients
4. A minimum 6-month notice is provided before sunsetting

## Version Information

The `/api/version` endpoint provides version information, including:

- Current version
- Available versions
- Version status (stable, beta, deprecated)
- Planned sunset dates for deprecated versions

## Documentation

Each API version has dedicated documentation:

- V1 API: `/api/v1/docs`
- V2 API: `/api/v2/docs`
- Combined docs: `/api/docs`

Documentation includes:

- Endpoint descriptions
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Error responses
- Examples
- Deprecation notices

## Migration Guides

When a new version introduces significant changes, we provide migration guides to help clients transition from older versions. Migration guides include:

- Feature comparison between versions
- Code examples for migrating to the new version
- Conversion tools where applicable
- Common migration issues and solutions

## Implementation Details

### NestJS Versioning

The platform uses NestJS's built-in versioning capabilities:

```typescript
app.enableVersioning({
  type: VersioningType.URI,
  defaultVersion: '1',
  prefix: 'api/v'
});
```

### Version-Specific Controllers

Controllers can specify version-specific endpoints:

```typescript
@Version('2')
@Get()
findAllV2() {
  // V2 implementation
}
```

### Version Decorators

Custom decorators simplify version handling:

```typescript
@ApiVersion({ version: '2', summary: 'V2 endpoint description' })
```

## Testing Strategy

Testing for versioned APIs includes:

1. Version-specific unit tests
2. Integration tests for each version
3. Compatibility tests between versions
4. Migration path testing

## Monitoring and Analytics

Each API version has separate monitoring to track:

- Usage patterns by version
- Error rates
- Performance metrics
- Deprecation notice effectiveness

## Conclusion

This versioning strategy ensures a stable and reliable API for clients while allowing for platform evolution. By following semantic versioning principles and providing clear migration paths, we maintain backward compatibility while enabling innovation.
