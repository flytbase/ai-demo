# Multi-tenant SaaS Platform Starter Kit
## Product Requirements Document

### 1. Product Overview

**Product Name:** MultiSaaS Platform

**Product Vision:** A robust, secure, and scalable multi-tenant SaaS platform starter kit that enables rapid development of services with comprehensive tenant management, user authentication, and role-based access control capabilities.

**Target Audience:** 
- Software developers building SaaS applications
- Startups looking to quickly launch multi-tenant services
- Enterprises requiring tenant isolation for departmental applications

**Core Value Proposition:** Reduce time-to-market for SaaS applications by providing a production-ready foundation that addresses the common challenges of multi-tenancy and authentication.

### 2. System Architecture Requirements

#### 2.1 Multi-tenancy Model

The system must support a comprehensive multi-tenant architecture with the following requirements:

- **Tenant Isolation:** Complete data isolation between tenants using a shared database with schema separation approach
- **Tenant Onboarding:** API endpoints for tenant creation, configuration, and management
- **Custom Domains:** Support for tenant-specific domains and white-labeling capabilities
- **Tenant Settings:** Configurable options per tenant including:
  - Branding elements (name, logo reference, colors)
  - Feature flags and entitlements
  - Contact information

#### 2.2 Authentication and Authorization

- **User Management:** Complete user lifecycle for each tenant:
  - User registration and invitation system
  - Email verification workflows
  - Password management (reset, change)
  - Profile management
- **Authentication:** Secure authentication system:
  - JWT-based authentication with appropriate expiration
  - Refresh token rotation
  - Rate limiting for security
  - MFA support (preparatory infrastructure)
- **Role-Based Access Control:**
  - Predefined roles (Super Admin, Tenant Admin, User)
  - Tenant-specific custom roles with granular permissions
  - Permission inheritance and hierarchy

#### 2.3 API Structure and Documentation

- **RESTful API Design:**
  - Consistent endpoint structure following REST principles
  - Proper use of HTTP methods and status codes
  - Comprehensive request/response validation
- **API Documentation:**
  - OpenAPI/Swagger specification
  - Interactive documentation for testing
  - Authentication and authorization examples
- **API Versioning:**
  - Support for versioned API endpoints
  - Deprecation strategy for backward compatibility

### 3. Technical Requirements

#### 3.1 Backend Technology Stack

- **Framework:** NestJS (Node.js)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with schema-based multi-tenancy
- **Authentication:** Passport.js with JWT strategy
- **ORM:** TypeORM for database interactions
- **API Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Testing:** Jest for unit and integration tests
- **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose

#### 3.2 Performance and Scalability

- **Caching Strategy:**
  - Redis for distributed caching
  - Appropriate cache invalidation strategies
- **Database Optimization:**
  - Efficient query patterns for multi-tenant data
  - Indexing strategy for common queries
  - Connection pooling configuration
- **Rate Limiting:**
  - Per-tenant rate limits for API endpoints
  - Configurable throttling policies

#### 3.3 Security Requirements

- **Data Protection:**
  - PII encryption at rest and in transit
  - Tenant data isolation guarantees
  - Audit logging for sensitive operations
- **API Security:**
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Protection against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
  - CORS configuration for API access
- **Compliance Readiness:**
  - Structured logging for audit trails
  - Data export capabilities for GDPR compliance
  - Retention policy infrastructure

### 4. Demonstration Scenarios

For the demo, we'll implement and showcase the following key flows:

#### 4.1 Tenant Management Flow

1. Create a new tenant with basic information
2. Configure tenant settings and feature flags
3. Show tenant isolation by creating multiple tenants
4. Demonstrate tenant-specific configurations

#### 4.2 User Management Flow

1. Create tenant administrator user
2. Invite additional users to a tenant
3. Assign different roles to users
4. Demonstrate role-based access restrictions

#### 4.3 Authentication Flow

1. Register a new user
2. Generate and validate JWT tokens
3. Implement refresh token rotation
4. Handle authentication errors and security protections

### 5. Success Criteria

The demonstration will be considered successful if we can show:

1. Complete tenant isolation with proper data separation
2. Secure user authentication and role-based permissions
3. Effective error handling and recovery
4. Comprehensive API documentation via Swagger

### 6. Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for this demonstration:

1. Front-end user interface implementation
2. Billing and subscription management
3. Full implementation of all GDPR compliance features
4. Advanced analytics and reporting features
5. Third-party integrations
6. Production deployment pipeline
