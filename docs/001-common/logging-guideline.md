# **Comprehensive Logging, Tracing & Observability Guidelines**

## **1\. Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**

**Context:**  
Our distributed system includes ffmpeg pipelines, Redis Pub/Sub, deep learning analytics, and a headless NestJS service that manages Playwright sessions for streaming via Agora. We require end-to-end observability—logging, metrics, and traces—to diagnose, monitor, and optimize our production environment while ensuring minimal performance overhead.

**Decision:**

* **Observability Stack:**  
  * Instrument all components with OpenTelemetry.  
  * Deploy OpenTelemetry (OTEL) Collectors on edge devices as Docker containers to locally aggregate and buffer telemetry data.  
  * Export telemetry data via the OTLP protocol from the edge collectors to SigNoz in the cloud.  
* **Platform Choice:**  
  * Use SigNoz as our unified backend for logs, metrics, and traces.  
* **Integration Strategy:**  
  * Leverage auto-instrumentation (via language-specific agents) and custom instrumentation where needed.  
  * Use asynchronous, non-blocking exporters to ensure telemetry does not impact main processing.  
* **Data Transmission:**  
  * Use OTLP for logs, metrics, and traces with proper buffering, batching, and retry policies.

**Consequences:**

* Unified telemetry with correlation IDs (trace\_id, span\_id) ensures end-to-end tracing.  
* Local edge processing reduces network latency and bandwidth consumption.  
* The open source stack minimizes vendor lock-in and licensing costs.

## **2\. Tools & SDK Choices**

### **Primary Tools:**

* **OpenTelemetry:**  
  * Instrumentation for logs, metrics, and traces.  
  * Supports auto-instrumentation for Java (Java Agent), Node.js (auto-instrumentations), and Python.  
* **SigNoz:**  
  * Unified dashboard for aggregating and correlating logs, metrics, and traces.  
* **OpenTelemetry Collector:**  
  * Deployed on edge devices (via Docker) to receive OTLP data from applications and push it to SigNoz.

### **Supplementary Tools:**

* **Log Forwarders (Optional):**  
  * Fluent Bit/Fluentd if legacy applications require additional log parsing.  
* **Templating Engines:**  
  * EJS, Handlebars, or NestJS built-in templating for dynamic injection into HTML.  
* **Auto-Instrumentation Agents:**  
  * For minimal code changes and consistent telemetry capture.

---

## **3\. Reasons Behind These Choices**

* **Standardization:**  
  * OpenTelemetry offers a vendor-neutral, unified approach for telemetry.  
* **Unified Observability:**  
  * SigNoz consolidates logs, metrics, and traces into a single pane, simplifying debugging and performance tuning.  
* **Operational Simplicity:**  
  * Auto-instrumentation and edge-based collectors reduce manual coding and network overhead.  
* **Resilience & Latency:**  
  * Deploying OTEL Collectors at the edge buffers data during network outages and lowers latency.  
* **Cost Efficiency:**  
  * An open source solution avoids expensive licensing fees while delivering enterprise-grade capabilities.

## **4\. Do's and Don'ts**

### **Do's:**

* **Standardize Log Formats:**

Use structured JSON logs with fields:  
json  
Copy  
`{`

  `"timestamp": "2025-02-27T12:00:00Z",`

  `"service": "SERVICE_NAME",`

  `"environment": "production",`

  `"level": "INFO",`

  `"message": "Description of event",`

  `"trace_id": "unique-trace-id",`

  `"span_id": "unique-span-id",`

  `"request_id": "unique-request-id",`

  `"context": {`

    `"device_id": "device123",`

    `"additional_field": "value"`

  `}`

`}`

*   
* **Include Correlation IDs:**  
  * Propagate `trace_id` and `span_id` in all telemetry for end-to-end correlation.  
* **Expose Health & Metrics Endpoints:**  
  * Implement `/metrics`, readiness, and liveness probes.  
* **Use Asynchronous Logging:**  
  * Configure OTLP exporters to use non-blocking, buffered calls.  
* **Leverage Auto-Instrumentation:**  
  * Integrate available agents for automatic telemetry capture.  
* **Secure Telemetry Data:**  
  * Encrypt data in transit (e.g., using TLS) and enforce strict access controls.  
* **Instrument Key Components:**  
  * FFmpeg pipelines, Redis Pub/Sub, DL pipelines, and Playwright sessions should all log key events and performance metrics.

### **Don'ts:**

* **Avoid Sensitive Data:**  
  * Do not log personally identifiable or sensitive information without proper redaction.  
* **Over-Log:**  
  * Avoid excessive verbosity that can overwhelm the system and obscure critical insights.  
* **Neglect Error Paths:**  
  * Ensure error and fallback scenarios are instrumented.  
* **Ignore Resource Overhead:**  
  * Continuously monitor and optimize telemetry to prevent performance degradation.

## **5\. Implementation Architecture**

### **Data Flow Overview:**

1. **Instrumentation:**  
   * Applications (ffmpeg, Playwright sessions, DL pipelines) are instrumented with OpenTelemetry SDKs.  
2. **Local Collection:**  
   * Telemetry data is sent via OTLP from each component to a locally deployed OpenTelemetry Collector (on the edge device).  
3. **Data Export:**  
   * The collector buffers and processes telemetry, then pushes data to SigNoz in the cloud.  
4. **Unified Dashboard:**  
   * SigNoz aggregates and displays logs, metrics, and traces for analysis, correlation, and alerting.

### **Auto-Instrumentation Integration:**

**Java:**  
bash  
Copy  
`java -javaagent:path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar -jar your-app.jar`

* 

**Node.js:**  
javascript  
Copy  
`const { registerInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/instrumentation');`

`const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node');`

`registerInstrumentations({ instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()] });`

* 

**Python:**  
bash  
Copy  
`opentelemetry-instrument python your_app.py`

*

## **6\. Docker Networking & OTEL Collector Setup**

### **Docker Networking:**

* **User-Defined Network:**  
  * Create a Docker network (e.g., `docker network create observability-network`) so that all containers can communicate via container names.

**OTEL Collector Container:**  
yaml  
Copy  
`services:`

  `otel-collector:`

    `image: otel/opentelemetry-collector:latest`

    `ports:`

      `- "4317:4317"`

    `networks:`

      `- observability-network`

    `command: ["--config=/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml"]`

* 

**NestJS Service Container:**  
yaml  
Copy  
`services:`

  `nestjs-service:`

    `build: .`

    `ports:`

      `- "3000:3000"`

    `environment:`

      `- OTEL_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector:4317`

    `networks:`

      `- observability-network`

* 

### **Injecting the OTEL Collector Endpoint:**

In the NestJS controller that renders the HTML, inject the OTEL collector endpoint from the environment:  
typescript  
Copy  
`res.render('index', {` 

  `deviceId,` 

  `streamingToken,` 

  `agoraAppId,` 

  `channel,` 

  `otelCollectorEndpoint: process.env.OTEL_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT,`

  `resolution,` 

  `frameRate,` 

  `lowLatency` 

`});`

* 

The HTML template then uses this value to send metrics:  
html  
Copy  
`<script>`

  `const otelCollectorEndpoint = "<%= otelCollectorEndpoint %>";`

  `function sendMetrics(metrics) {`

    `fetch(otelCollectorEndpoint + '/metrics/ingest', {`

      `method: 'POST',`

      `body: JSON.stringify({`

        `deviceId: currentDeviceId,`

        `metrics: metrics,`

        `timestamp: new Date().toISOString()`

      `}),`

      `headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }`

    `}).catch(err => console.error('Metrics send failed:', err));`

  `}`

`</script>`

*

## **7\. Component-Specific Considerations**

### **FFmpeg Pipelines:**

* Log process events (startup, shutdown, errors) and performance metrics (frame rate, encoding latency, CPU/GPU usage).  
* Inject trace IDs in logs for correlation.

### **Redis Pub/Sub:**

* Log subscription, publication, and delivery events with trace context.  
* Monitor message throughput, latency, and connection health.

### **Deep Learning Analytics Pipelines:**

* Log inference requests, processing times, and errors.  
* Capture resource metrics (GPU/CPU usage, latency) and include trace IDs.

## **9\. Final Summary**

This guidelines document outlines a production-grade observability strategy that:

* Leverages OpenTelemetry, SigNoz, and edge-deployed OTEL Collectors.  
* Uses a unified NestJS service to manage streaming sessions via Playwright and Agora integration.  
* Dynamically injects configuration (including OTEL collector endpoints) into the HTML rendered for headless Playwright sessions.  
* Utilizes Docker networking to ensure seamless communication between containers.  
* Provides detailed API endpoints for session management and configuration.  
* Includes specific instrumentation guidelines for ffmpeg, Redis, and deep learning pipelines.
